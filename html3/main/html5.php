                  <p class="text-justify" style="margin: 25px">Harry Houdini is probably the most famous <b> (0) </b> <u>magician</u> in history. His name is associated with incredible escapes, and his <b>(31)</b> ______ to get out of apparently <b> (32)</b>______ situations made him a legend in his own time.  </p>
                
                  <p class="text-justify" style="margin: 25px"><b>(33) </b> ______, at the beginning of his career, Houdini was a <b> (34)</b>______. For the first five years, he tried every type of magic, from card tricks to box escapes. In 1896, disillusioned and ready to give up, he actually put an <b> (35)</b>________ in the newspaper offering to sell all of his magic and secrets for $20. There were no <b> (36)</b>______! </p>
                  
                  <p class="text-justify" style="margin: 25px">Eventually, Houdini became famous due to his talent for <b> (37)</b>______ escaping from police handcuffs and jails. However, one of Houdini’s most <b> (38)</b> ______ acts was to swallow several needles and thread <b> (39)</b>______ and then pull them out, all carefully tied together. Other tricks consisted of escaping from straitjackets (used to control violent psychiatric patients) while hanging upside down or immersed in water. </p>
                  
                  <p class="text-justify" style="margin: 25px">In 1919, Houdini entered the world of film <b>(40)</b> ______ as both producer and actor, performing many of the most dangerous scenes himself. <b>(41)</b> ______, in spite of all of his efforts, the films were not very <b>(42)</b> ______. Today they are nearly all completely <b>(43)</b> ______–except to Houdini fans, of course!  </p>
                  
                  <p class="text-justify" style="margin: 25px">Houdini’s life was <b>(44)</b> ______, and his death from peritonitis in 1926 was just as unusual. Some consider that the direct cause was a punch to the body in one of his acts; others blame Houdini’s stubborn <b>(45)</b> ______ to deal with a medical problem. The truth, of course, like much of his life, will probably remain a mystery.</p>
