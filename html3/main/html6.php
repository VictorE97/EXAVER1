               <p>Dear Liz, </p>
               <p class="text-justify">Sorry for not writing earlier. I’ve really had very <b>(0) </b> <u>little</u> time because of all the preparations for the wedding. In fact, this is why I’m writing. You see the preparations aren’t going at <b> (46)</b>_________well and it would be great <b>(47)</b> ___________ you could give me a bit of advice.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="text-justify">When we got engaged 18 months ago I got <b>(48)</b> _______ sides of the family together and discussed budgets. I even gave everybody a list <b> (49)</b>______ estimated costs and ideas and asked how much they could contribute. At first <b>(50)</b> ________ seemed ok. If you remember, my parents are divorced, so my dad and stepmother offered to pay <b> (51)</b>____most of the wedding (reception, food, invitations, photography, DJ, welcome dinner, thank-you cards, and <b>(52)</b>______ on). My mom, <b> (53)</b>_______the other hand, promised to finance the flowers, my dress, decorations, the cake, and the brunch the day after the wedding. This is so generous <b> (54)</b>________her as she doesn’t have much money. Of course, Larry and I are contributing towards the cost of the honeymoon and transport for everyone, <b>(55)</b> _______to mention the license, Larry’s suit and the wedding rings.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="text-justify">We thought Larry’s parents <b>(56)</b> _______take charge of the souvenirs, the rehearsal and the wine for the reception. At least this is <b> (57)</b>_______they originally agreed to do. Now they say they’ve only got money for the souvenirs and have refused to buy <b>(58)</b> ________else.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="text-justify">What do you think? Should I <b>(59)</b> ________ my family pay all of the costs? Should I change plans and just have a barbecue  <b>(60)</b> _______than a fancy wedding? Please, tell me what to do!</p>
               <br>
               <p>Love, Janice </p>
